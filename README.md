# üìò LeetCode Solves

### **Overview**

This repository serves as a structured collection of my **LeetCode problem solutions**, systematically organized by topic and difficulty level.
It reflects my ongoing journey of mastering **data structures, algorithms, and analytical problem-solving** through consistent practice and documentation.

---

Each directory represents a **problem category**, and each file corresponds to a **specific LeetCode problem** solved with clarity and optimization.

---

### **üéØ Objectives**

* Strengthen understanding of **core algorithmic principles**.
* Enhance **problem-solving speed** and **code optimization**.
* Maintain a **personal reference base** for revisiting key concepts.
* Track progress and growth in **competitive programming** and **technical interview preparation**.

---

### **üß© Topics Covered**

* Arrays and Strings
* Linked Lists
* Stacks and Queues
* Trees and Graphs
* Recursion and Backtracking
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy Algorithms
* Hashing and Sliding Window
* Bit Manipulation
* Sorting and Searching

### **‚öôÔ∏è Usage**

To explore or test the solutions locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maharshijd/LeetCode-Solves.git
```

Each solution file includes:

* A concise problem statement reference.
* The implemented approach.
* Space and time complexity (where applicable).
